          <p className="card-description">
            Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret
            reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of
            hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and
            behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.
            People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. Early
            treatment may help get symptoms under control before serious
            complications develop and may help improve the long-term outlook.
